Task1: 
Create a list 'stud_list' containing [studentname, roll_num, class, maths_marks, physics_marks, science_marks]


Task2: 
Add english_marks to the above list using list function.


Task3: 
Print only student marks in list format. Hint: list slicing


Task4: 
There is some correction in the maths_marks, one equation was wrong, so 4 marks are given to students. 
So change the maths_marks and add 4 to it. and print the updated list.


Task5: 
Create 2 new lists containing information about 5 students.
One list for student names - ['stud1', 'stud2' ......, 'stud5']
One for roll_num - [101, 103,....,106]


Task6:
Create a dictionary 'stud_info' from lists created above.
Hint: zip() and dict()


Task7:
Print the (stud_name,roll_num) tuples from the stud_info dictionary.


Task8:
Create two sets 'set1' and 'set2', 
set1 being the '5' names of areas of Mumbai.
{'andheri','kurla',.....'bandra'}

set2 being the '5' name of areas of navi Mumbai.
{'nerul','vashi',.....'airoli'}


Task9:
Make a union of set1 and set2, and make Mumbai as a whole city.



Task10:
Convert the whole Mumbai city set to list and tuples.
Hint: list() and tuple()


Task11:
Create a list of square of index position. List should have 100 numbers. Use list comprehension.
Hint: lst = [i for i in range(100)]
Output should look like [0,1,4,9,16....,9801]


Task12:
Create a dictionary same as above requirement, the key should be index now. {index:square of index}
Output should look like this:
{0:0, 1:1, 2:4, 3:9,.....,99:9801}
